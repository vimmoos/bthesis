* Abstract
* Introduction
+ Problem -> search space too large -> low sample efficiency
+ How to solve this problem
+ Possible solution -> use AE to learn a low dimensional representation
+ decrease search space -> increase sample efficiency
* Theoretical Background
+ RL
  + PPO+IL
+ Representation Learning
  + AE
  + VAE
  + PCA
* Methods
+ Imitation data
+ Learn to see
  + Gather data
  + Pre process datasets
+ Learn to act
* Results
+ show results
* Releated work
+ DARLA
+ ROBOT skill learning
+ on the use of DAE for efficient RL
* Discussion and Limitation
+ Data used to train autoencoders
+ Offline vs Online  autoencoder training
+ action should also be encoded

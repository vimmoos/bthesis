* Overview
** Project scope
  The project aim to build an autoencoder for dimensionality
  reduction. In particular, this will be used to hopefully enhance the

* Lines of Thoughts
** Autoencoder
An Autoencoder is a special network architecture which approximate two
different function *encode* and *decode* such as:
$$decode(encode(\hat{X})) = \hat{X}$$
#+begin_info
*Note*  most of the the time is not an \equal but an \approx
#+end_info

The network is therefore composed by two different sub networks. An
Encoder which can be defined as:
$$encode \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^m $$
And a Decoder which can be defined as:
$$decode \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n $$

There two constraint to this two function. The first one is that
*decode* must be approximately the inverse of the *encode*[fn:ae_saferl]. The second one is that
$$ m << n $$
#+begin_info
*NOTE* when the second constraint is sudisfacted, the autoencoder is
 cosidered an undercomplete autoencoder. However, every time we will
 use the autoencoder word we will refer to undercomplete autoencoder.
#+end_info
The second constraint is an architectural one, meanwhile the first one
is a functional constraint which will be achived after the network is
trained.

The error function is therefore a reconstruction error or distance
measure between the input and outuput.

The layer between the Encoder and the Decoder express what is usually
knonw as *Latent space* which dimensionality is $\mathbb{R}^m$.

We will from now on refer to the *Latent space* as $\hat{z}$.
For clarity we can rewrite the above formulas as:
$$encode(\hat{X}) = \hat{z}$$
$$decode(\hat{z}) \approx \hat{X}$$

** TODO PCA
find a linear subspace with lower dimension than the initial dataset
while trying to maintain most of the variability
*** Assumptions
+ Linear dimensions
+ approximately normally distributed data
** TODO LDA
linear approach
** TODO LLE
non-linear approach
** TODO Isomap
non linear generalization of classical multidimensional scaling

* Ideas for Hyperparameters
  Since we will have to fit quite a lot of hyperparameters we tried to come
  up with some cleaver ideas to remove some  of these
  hyperparameters.

** Number of neurons per layer

  The first hyperparameters we would like to remove is the number of
  neurons per layer. Since we are doing an autoencoder and therefore
  we are trying to find a compression function *f* we can assume that
  the number of neurons per layer is defined by some kind of function
  *h* that given the number of layers *N*, the numeber of dimension of
  the input *I* and the final number of dimension of the latent space
  *Z* returns the number of neurons for a specific layer.
  This function can be either linear or non-linear. The first
  intuition is that if *h* is linear it should be somewhat easier to
  learn a good compression function *f*. However, until now, we do not
  have any mathematical backgroud for this intuition! We need to do
  more research!

  The first possible implementation of this function is defined as
  follows: (*n* is the index of the layer for which we are trying to
  find the number of neurons)

  $$n_1 = I$$
  $$n_N = Z$$
  $$n_i = n_{i+1}*\lambda$$
  From these equations we can find out the equation which define the
  value of \lambda quite intuitevely.
  $$ \lambda = \sqrt[N-1]{\frac{I}{Z}} $$
  Now we can derive the number of layers given the
  number of neurons for the first and last layer
  $$ n_i = n_N * \prod_{x=1}^{N-i}  \lambda $$
  $$ n_i= n_N * \lambda^{N-1}$$
  Substitute \lambda with the prievious found equation.
  $$ n_i = n_N *  \left(\sqrt[N-1]{\frac{I}{Z}}\right)^ {N-i} $$
  $$ n_i = n_N * \left(\frac{I}{Z}\right)^{\frac{N-i}{N-1}} $$
  $$ n_i = Z * \left(\frac{I}{Z}\right)^{\frac{N-i}{N-1}} $$

* Autoencoders
** DONE Vanilla
CLOSED: [2022-01-21 Fri 15:24]
    The vanilla autoencoder is the classical one. Composed by an
    encoder and a decoder without any kind of constriction.
** DONE VAE
CLOSED: [2022-01-21 Fri 15:24]
    The Variational autoencoder is a modified version of a vanilla AE
    which forces the distribution of the latent space to be a
    gaussian.
** DONE AVB
CLOSED: [2022-01-21 Fri 15:24]
    Adversarial Variational Bayes is a relatively new ideas which
    exploits some Bayesian concept to force a particular latent space
    distribution. All is done in an adversarial environment.
** HOLD B-VAE

      + shows how to achive better disentangled representations
      + introduces a new hyperparameter (\beta) which forces the
        posterior to be closer to the isotropic unit Gaussian (prior)
      + Introduces a new metric for measuring the disentanglement
        (independece + interpretability)
      + reconstruction error should not be used to discriminate

***** Summary
      + Introduces AVB
      + Adversarial procedure
      + focuses on giving better flexibility to the normal VAE
        procedure
      + Quite interesting approach however,does not focuses on
        disentagling the representation so, even tho, it achieve on
        average better results than a normal VAE maybe it is not
        suitable in a RL framework. Testing is need to asses the
        performance.

***** Summary
      + Interesting approach to dimensionality reduction which tries
        to focus on the main downfall of the AE
      + However, does not look like anymore progress was done in this
        direction

***** Summary
      + Shows crucial down fall of the ELBO objective.
      + Introduces a new objective.
      + Quite interesting cause it tries to balance the mutual
        information between the X and Z while trying to force the
        posterior distribution to a family of distribution
        (e.g. Guassian)
      + It is a generalization of the \beta-VAE, VAE and Adversarial
        AE
      + Also shows how it is possible to change the divergence metric
        in this new objective function (the only requirement is that
        it must be a strict divergence metric (i.e. D(p,q) = 0 iff
        p(x) = q(x)))
      + This new objective also focuses on learning disentagled
        representations
      + REALLY INTERESTING in particular in an RL framework since
        it parametrize both mutual information and disentaglement.

     [[file:resources/AAE.png]]

***** Summary
      + introduces formally the AAE
      + The main difference between VAE and AAE is that the KL term
        (or cross entropy) is replaced with a discriminator network
	to force and adversarial learning process
      + Moreover, in constrast to VAE, we do not need to have a
        functional form of the posterior distribution we want to
        force. We just need to be able to sample from it.
      + The objective of the AE is to both minimize the reconstruction
        error and to fool as best as possible the discriminator.
      + The discriminator is used to discriminate between the wanted
        posterior and the actual latent space distribution

      + Quite interesting however, does not look like it focus on
        disentangled representations but on the reconstruction error
        which maybe is not suitable if the main point is to use it
        within an RL framework. However, it can be interesting to test
        it.

*Contributions*
#+begin_verse
We start from auto-encoder and focus on its ability to reduce
the dimensionality, trying to understand the difference between
auto-encoder and state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction
methods. The results show that auto-encoder indeed learn
something different from other methods.
#+end_verse

#+begin_verse
We preliminarily investigate the influence of the number of
hidden layer nodes on the performance of auto-encoder on
MNIST and Olivetti face datasets. The results reveal its possible
relation with the intrinsic dimensionality.
#+end_verse
***** Summary
Shows comparison of Autoencoder and other dimensionality reduction
methods (e.g. PCA,LLE) Notable results: Autoencoder different than
other dimensionality reduction. Potentially detect repetitive
structures. Dimensionality of the *Latent space* is best when it
maches the intrinsic dimensionality of the dataset.

***** Opinions
This clearly shows how Autoencoder can be essentially different and
more usefull than other dimensionality reduction methods. This
consolidate the choice of using autoencoders in the thesis.

***** Summary
Show how AEs were already used in astrony for different dimensionality
reduction/classification task with success. Moreover, it aims to
address the limitation of PCA using VAE. Results show how on this
dataset (SDSS sloan digital sky survey) the autoencoder outperforms
PCA in particular with low dimension latent space(or component for
PCA)
They mainly use InfoVAE[fn:infovae],a variant of the VAE, focused on trying to
disentangle (e.i. force mapping different inputs to disjoint distribution ) the different latent space dimensions.

It was *DISCARDED* because it contains too specific content and the
comparison between algorithms has multiple steps and variables which
are highly specific to the task. Therefore I do not think it should be
used.

[[file:resources/The-novel-architecture-of-an-Adversarial-Variational-AutoEncoder-with-Dual-Matching.png]]

***** Summary
It introduces a novel Adversarial autoencoder architecture named
AVE-DM (Adversarial Variational autoencoder with dual matching )
The main difference between this new architecture and the prievious
proposed Adversarial autoencoders[fn:aae] is that it has 2
discriminator (hence the name dual matching).
Main Results: Shows how AVE-DM outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods such us PCA, UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection),
t-SNE (T-distributed sochastic neighbor embedding ) etc.
Note: The interesting part of the data is that it have dropout event
(the reason for it is quite technical and specific to RNA
sequencing). This dropout event are zero expression measurament that
can be either biological or technical. This phenomenon result in poor
results for methods such us PCA or t-SNE.

*Quotes*
#+begin_verse
It inherits the idea of variational inference to use a distribution to approximate the posterior distribution[fn:original_vae]. The
diference is that VAE considers the posterior distribution
of all data simultaneously and approximates each posterior
distribution with distribution, minimizing KL divergence.
#+end_verse


#+begin_verse
It has many advantages,
including fast training, stability, and so on, so it has a wide
range of theoretical models and industry applications.

***** Summary
Introduces a new variational framework  for combinatorial optimization
(e.g. TSP). Introduces Variational inference and VAE. Propose VARL
(Variational autoencoder-based reinforcement learning) which exploits
variational inference ideas to learn efiiciently and effectively a
solution in a graph-based framework.

***** Opinions
The main down side is that the VARL architecture seems to be quite
complex and specific for combinatorial optimization. That said, it
also shows how variational inference can be effectively used in
combination with reinforcement learning (in the paper REINFOCE was
specifically used.)

***** Summary
      + Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for statistical learning
      + Shows that Autoencoder-based latent space is more effective
        than PCA-based latent space

      + Tanh as hidden activation function and linear for output
      + Interesting enough the AE with only Linear activation function
        still performs better than PCA (researcher stated that maybe
        it's due to the fact that AE latent space dimensions do not
        have to be orthogonal (interesting!))
      + RL converges faster and it is more stable in latent space with
        respect to DMP space (this is true for both PCA and AE)
      + Moreover RL+AE outperforms RL+PCA! researcher stated that this
        is probably due to the non linearity in AE
      + In particular during the introduction sections it has a lot of
        good references which are worth looking into.

      + Introduces DVAE architecture
      + Main aims is to model environments with sparse rewards in
        order to perform offline RL.
      + Main problems: if the exploration in the real environment is
        constly. Then this techinique does not behave as the
        environments in the unexplored states.
      + Quite interesting, however, not fitting for highly complex and

***** Summary
      + Defines a new RL method with AE
      + Interesting is that a new method for approximating the ELBO is
        introduced. Using MC methods.
      + *NOTE* Interesting part is that latent space mapping and policy are
        learned toghether. However, policy is update more frequently
        then the latent space. Which stabilize the learning process.

***** Summary
      + Shows how using AE-based latent space reduce the time of
        convergence. Moreover, it also produce more vaiable policies
        faster.
      + The main downsite with respect to the thesis is that a big
        part of this advantage is due to the fact that images were the
        input to the AE. Of course, this is the main reason why the
        vanilla RL performs drastically worst than the one with the
        Convolutional AE.
      + However, seems another good source of information which again
        shows that AE-based latent space increase the RL performance
